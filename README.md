# PhoneBattery
PhoneBattery is a simple utility that lets you check your phone's battery life on your Apple Watch. It is very simple and doesn't do anything else than that.

PhoneBattery is also **available for free** on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonebattery-your-phones-battery/id1009278300?ls=1&mt=8)!

I had the initial idea for this on the plane from WWDC back to Germany, polished it at home and here it is now. Please let me know what you think of it!
